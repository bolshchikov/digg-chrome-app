# Digg Reader Chrome App

## Overview
Digg reader is nice and sleek RSS reader after Google Reader has been closed. The only disadvantage is that 
it doesn't have chrome hosted app, such that we can install and have a big icon of a app. This repository 
solves this problem until digg adds their application to the chrome store.

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Google Chrome
3. Go to Tools -> Extensions
4. Enable "Developer mode" checkbox
5. Click "Load unpacked extension"
6. Choose the folder of the cloned project
7. Click "Select"
